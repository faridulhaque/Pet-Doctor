## Pets Doctor 
Live link [Pets Doctor](https://assignment10-petsdoctor.web.app/)
* This project is based on a private vet who provides treatment for pets.
* The project has 4 main pages Home, Blog, About and Sign In. 
* The Home page contains a banner in the top, three cards in the middle where services about the doctor are described, a section containing some upcoming offer in the last row. 
* The about page has the answers of the questions provided by PH and in the Bog page some information about me. 
* In the Middle of the home page some cards which contained three button on each of them will take you to the dynamic pages. 
* There are Sign in page and also a sign up page which you can visit by clicking sign up button in the sign in page. 
* I use vanilla bootstrap and React Router for the project. Also took some help from hotToast and react firebase hook.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
